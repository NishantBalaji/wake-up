# Wake Up!

## Inspiration
As involved members of our school communities we came to the realization that many people don't have the knowledge about many issues in the world, and wanted to provide them with a way to learn more about these. Especially with the many issues in the world today, we wanted to give a platform for these issues to become more well known in the world.

## What it does
In this web app, we provided a way for users to search common issues and problems in society. They can also search for actions related to these issues, such as volunteering events or petitions. This allows individuals to increase their knowledge of the problem as well as contribute to the solution. Users can also add their own articles for others to see, bringing awareness to social issues around the world.

## How we built it
We  built and created the Web App using the MERN Stack. The MongoDB server connected the application to a server to store our data. Express helps connect the front to the backend. The React creates the UI and the frontend and Node runs JavaScript in a browser environment.

## Challenges we ran into
Over the course of this project, we encountered quite a few learning experiences. Originally, we planned on sorting search results by date. However, because different article and action urls had different date formats, we were unable to standardize a date sorting method. To overcome this, we sorted results by relevancy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Developed a website from scratch
- Utilized databases to present search results
- Brought awareness to social injustices faced by others around the world
- Educated ourselves during the process

## What we learned
Not only did this project teach us valuable lessons on Full Stack Web Development, but it also brought awareness to social issues prevalent in society today. We learned to educate ourselves, while also providing resources for others to learn more about the problems others face. In addition, this project allowed us to exercise vital teamwork and communication skills that will undoubtedly carry over to future endeavors.

## What's next for WakeUp
This project is just a taste of what we have in store for the future. We plan to expand WakeUp to the public, further optimizing search results, improving the website's aesthetic, and marketing our product to citizens around the world. We hope to continue making a difference in our communities through this educational campaign, in order to defeat the many injustices in society today.
